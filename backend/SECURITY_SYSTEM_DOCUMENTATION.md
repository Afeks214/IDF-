## üîß Configuration

### Security Settings
All security configurations are centralized in `config.py`:

```python
class SecuritySettings:
    # JWT Configuration
    SECRET_KEY: str = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)
    ALGORITHM: str = "HS256"
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES: int = 30
    REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES: int = 10080  # 7 days
    
    # Password Security
    PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH: int = 12
    PASSWORD_REQUIRE_UPPERCASE: bool = True
    PASSWORD_REQUIRE_LOWERCASE: bool = True
    PASSWORD_REQUIRE_NUMBERS: bool = True
    PASSWORD_REQUIRE_SPECIAL: bool = True
    PASSWORD_HASH_ROUNDS: int = 14
    
    # Rate Limiting
    RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE: int = 60
    AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE: int = 5
    
    # Audit Logging
    AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED: bool = True
    AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS: int = 365
    
    # Geographical Security
    ALLOWED_COUNTRIES: List[str] = ["IL"]  # Israel only
```

### Environment Variables
Security settings can be overridden with environment variables:
- `SECURITY_SECRET_KEY`: JWT secret key
- `SECURITY_PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH`: Minimum password length
- `SECURITY_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`: Rate limiting threshold
- `SECURITY_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED`: Enable/disable audit logging

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Authentication
```python
from core.security import security_manager, jwt_manager

# Hash password
password_hash = security_manager.hash_password("user_password")

# Verify password
is_valid = security_manager.verify_password("user_password", password_hash)

# Create JWT token
token = await jwt_manager.create_access_token({"sub": "user_id", "role": "officer"})

# Verify JWT token
payload = await jwt_manager.verify_token(token)
```

### RBAC Implementation
```python
from core.security import check_permissions, UserRole, Permission

# Check single permission
has_access = check_permissions(UserRole.OFFICER, Permission.DATA_READ)

# Check multiple permissions
permissions = [Permission.DATA_READ, Permission.DATA_WRITE]
has_all_access = check_multiple_permissions(UserRole.OFFICER, permissions)
```

### Security Decorators
```python
from core.security import require_permission, require_role, Permission, UserRole

@require_permission(Permission.DATA_WRITE)
async def sensitive_operation():
    # Only users with DATA_WRITE permission can access
    pass

@require_role(UserRole.OFFICER)
async def military_operation():
    # Only officers and above can access
    pass
```

### Audit Logging
```python
from core.security import security_manager, SecurityEventType

# Log security event
await security_manager.log_security_event(
    SecurityEventType.DATA_ACCESS,
    user_id="user123",
    user_ip="192.168.1.100",
    resource="/api/classified-data",
    action="read",
    result="SUCCESS",
    severity="HIGH"
)
```

### Threat Detection
```python
from core.security import ThreatDetectionSystem

threat_detector = ThreatDetectionSystem()

# Check for threats in request data
request_data = {
    'ip': '192.168.1.200',
    'user_agent': 'sqlmap/1.0',
    'content': 'SELECT * FROM users'
}

threats = await threat_detector.detect_threats(request_data)
```
